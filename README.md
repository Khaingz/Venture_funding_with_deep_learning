# Venture_funding_with_deep_learning
Challenge13

# Description

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soup’s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

# Instructions:

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

### Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

Step 1. Read the applicants_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame. Review the DataFrame, looking for categorical variables that will need to be encoded, as well as columns that could eventually define your features and target variables.

#### Read the applicants_data.csv file from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame
applicant_data_df = pd.read_csv(Path
    ('./Resources/applicants_data.csv'))

####  Review the DataFrame
applicant_data_df.head()

####  Review the data types associated with the columns
applicant_data_df.dtypes

Step 2. Drop the “EIN” (Employer Identification Number) and “NAME” columns from the DataFrame, because they are not relevant to the binary classification model.

#### Drop the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns from the DataFrame
applicant_data_df = applicant_data_df.drop(columns=['EIN','NAME'])

#### Review the DataFrame
applicant_data_df.head()

Step 3. Encode the dataset’s categorical variables using OneHotEncoder, and then place the encoded variables into a new DataFrame.

#### Create a list of categorical variables 
categorical_variables = list(applicant_data_df.dtypes[applicant_data_df.dtypes =="object"].index)

#### Display the categorical variables list
categorical_variables

#### Create a OneHotEncoder instance
enc = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)

#### Encode the categorcal variables using OneHotEncoder
encoded_data = enc.fit_transform(applicant_data_df[categorical_variables])

#### Create a DataFrame with the encoded variables
encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(
    encoded_data,
    columns = enc.get_feature_names_out(categorical_variables))

#### Review the DataFrame
encoded_df.head()

Step 4. Add the original DataFrame’s numerical variables to the DataFrame containing the encoded variables. Note To complete this step, you will employ the Pandas concat() function that was introduced earlier in this course.

#### Create a list of numerical variables
numerical_variables = list(applicant_data_df.dtypes[applicant_data_df.dtypes =="int64"].index)

#### Display the numerical variables list
numerical_variables

#### Add the numerical variables from the original DataFrame to the one-hot encoding DataFrame
encoded_df = pd.concat([encoded_df,applicant_data_df[numerical_variables]],axis=1)

#### Review the Dataframe
encoded_df.head()

Step 5. Using the preprocessed data, create the features (X) and target (y) datasets. The target dataset should be defined by the preprocessed DataFrame column “IS_SUCCESSFUL”. The remaining columns should define the features dataset.

#### Define the target set y using the IS_SUCCESSFUL column
y = encoded_df['IS_SUCCESSFUL']

#### Display a sample of y
y.head()

#### Define features set X by selecting all columns but IS_SUCCESSFUL
X = encoded_df.drop(columns='IS_SUCCESSFUL')

#### Review the features DataFrame
X.head()

Step 6. Split the features and target sets into training and testing datasets.
#### Split the preprocessed data into a training and testing dataset
#### Assign the function a random_state equal to 1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=1)

#### Create a StandardScaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()

Step 7. Use scikit-learn's StandardScaler to scale the features data.
#### Fit the scaler to the features training dataset
X_scaler = scaler.fit(X_train)

#### Fit the scaler to the features training dataset
X_train_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_test)

## Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
Use knowledge of TensorFlow to design a binary classification deep neural network model. This model should use the dataset’s features to predict whether an Alphabet Soup–funded startup will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Consider the number of inputs before determining the number of layers that your model will contain or the number of neurons on each layer. Then, compile and fit your model. Finally, evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

To do so, complete the following steps:

Step 1. Create a deep neural network by assigning the number of input features, the number of layers, and the number of neurons on each layer using Tensorflow’s Keras.
Hint You can start with a two-layer deep neural network model that uses the relu activation function for both layers.
Optimize the neural network model.

Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), preprocess the dataset so that you can use it to compile and evaluate the neural network model later.

#### Define the the number of inputs (features) to the model
number_input_features = len(X_train.iloc[0])

#### Review the number of features
number_input_features

#### Define the number of neurons in the output layer
number_output_neurons = 1

#### Define the number of hidden nodes for the first hidden layer
hidden_nodes_layer1 =  (number_input_features +1) // 2

#### Review the number hidden nodes in the first layer
hidden_nodes_layer1

#### Define the number of hidden nodes for the second hidden layer
hidden_nodes_layer2 = (hidden_nodes_layer1 +1) // 2 

#### Review the number hidden nodes in the second layer
hidden_nodes_layer2

#### Create the Sequential model instance
nn = Sequential()

#### Add the first hidden layer
nn.add(Dense(units=hidden_nodes_layer1, input_dim=number_input_features, activation="relu"))

#### Add the second hidden layer
nn.add(Dense(units=hidden_nodes_layer2, activation="relu"))

#### Add the output layer to the model specifying the number of output neurons and activation function
nn.add(Dense(units=1, activation="sigmoid"))

#### Display the Sequential model summary
nn.summary()

Step 2. Compile and fit the model using the binary_crossentropy loss function, the adam optimizer, and the accuracy evaluation metric.
Hint When fitting the model, start with a small number of epochs, such as 20, 50, or 100.

#### Compile the Sequential model
nn.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy",optimizer="adam", metrics=["accuracy"])

#### Fit the model using 50 epochs and the training data
fit_model = nn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train , epochs=50)

Step 3. Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the model’s loss and accuracy.

#### Evaluate the model loss and accuracy metrics using the evaluate method and the test data
model_loss, model_accuracy = nn.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test, verbose=2)

#### Display the model loss and accuracy results
print(f"Loss: {model_loss}, Accuracy: {model_accuracy}")

Step 4. Save and export your model to an HDF5 file, and name the file AlphabetSoup.h5.

#### Set the model's file path
file_path = "./Resources/AlphabetSoup.h5"

#### Export your model to a HDF5 file
nn.save_weights(file_path)

## Optimize the Neural Network Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow and Keras, optimize your model to improve the model's accuracy. Even if you do not successfully achieve a better accuracy, you'll need to demonstrate at least two attempts to optimize the model. You can include these attempts in your existing notebook. Or, you can make copies of the starter notebook in the same folder, rename them, and code each model optimization in a new notebook.

Note You will not lose points if your model does not achieve a high accuracy, as long as you make at least two attempts to optimize the model.

To do so, complete the following steps:

Define at least three new deep neural network models (the original plus 2 optimization attempts). With each, try to improve on your first model’s predictive accuracy.
Rewind Recall that perfect accuracy has a value of 1, so accuracy improves as its value moves closer to 1. To optimize your model for a predictive accuracy as close to 1 as possible, you can use any or all of the following techniques:

Adjust the input data by dropping different features columns to ensure that no variables or outliers confuse the model.

Add more neurons (nodes) to a hidden layer.

Add more hidden layers.

Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.

Add to or reduce the number of epochs in the training regimen.
